# Change Log - emonPi Discrete Sampling Firmware

# V2.2 (30/01/15)
 * Reduction in SRAM memory usage thanks to F-macro serial string implementation

# V2.1 (20/1/16)
  * Allow use of group 0

# V2.0 (17/11/15)
  * Don't print ACK's to serial 

# V1.9 (16/11/15)
  * Fix counting pulses faster than 110ms, strobed meter LED http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/11490

# V1.8 (30/10/15)
  * Enable pulse count INT1 internal pull-up to fix spurious pulse count readings
 
# V1.7 (12/06/15)
  * Fix bug which stopped USA AC-AC Vcal from being applied at runtime

# V1.6 (12/06/15)
  * Fix interrupt pulse debouce issue by limiting pulse width to 52ms min (50ms is default for LED pulse output meters) 
  * Compile with latest JeeLib with fix for RF hang, remove RF reset added in V1.3 (bf179057ee1abc2cfa2965b454421203ac52c6c3)
  * Enable simultaneous pulse counting and temperature monitoring on single RJ45 using breakout

# V1.5 (27/05/15)
  * Change pulse count to be stored as unsigned long datatype
  * Add new variable power 1 + power 2 as third item in the node struct. This will be useful for US installs and Solar PV type 2 installations to provide a feed for consumption (solar PV + grid import / export)

**Important Note:**
After this update a manual change will be required to emonhub.conf, copy and paste the following to override the node decoder for the emonPi node [[5]] in the Nodes section of emonhub.conf:
```
[[5]]
    nodename = emonPi
    firmware = emonPi_RFM69CW_RF12Demo_DiscreteSampling.ino
    hardware = emonpi
    [[[rx]]]
        names = power1,power2,power1_plus_power2,Vrms,T1,T2,T3,T4,T5,T6,pulseCount
        datacodes = h, h, h, h, h, h, h, h, h, h, L
        scales = 1,1,1,0.01,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,0.1,1
        units = W,W,W,V,C,C,C,C,C,C,p
```
